# The-WeatherCat-Dashboard ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/TheIPM/My-Portfolio?style=plastic) ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/TheIPM)


## Description

This is the fifth weekly challenge for the my boot camp. This challenge involved creating a weather dashboard which draws data from an API, in this case Open Weathermap. You can search any city in the world and get the weather forecast for the next 5 days (including the day you are using it). There are 2 cats on the screen modelled after my own cats, so if you like cats you will love this!
